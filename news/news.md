**July 4, 2023, Accepted Paper**: Another work ours using ECGs + deep learning got accepted at PLOS Neglected Tropical
Diseases. We show that deep learning models can be used to detect Chagas disease from ECGs, aiding in early detection\

**May 11, 2023, Accepted Paper**: Our paper on invertible kernel PCA got accepted at IEEE Signal Processing Letters.
We present a simple but effective method to invert the kernel PCA operations in an invertible subdomain which is 
sufficient for reconstruction in many scenarios.\

**January 03, 2023, Research Visit**: I will visit Misha Belkin's group at UC San Diego from 1st of March to 27th of May.
During that time we will work on generalization of overparameterized models.\
