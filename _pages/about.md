I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Tübingen AI center](https://tuebingen.ai){:target="_blank"} at the University of Tübingen, Germany working with [Jakob Macke](https://www.mackelab.org){:target="_blank"}. 

My research is fairly diverse.
Mainly, I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations.
I am interested in
- low-dimensional data representation learning,
- modelling of temporal data,
- the role of overparameterization,
- unsupervised representation learning.

On the applied side, my research uses deep models for the evaluation of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings to
(1) support physicians with diagnosis and (2) explore the information within those recordings.

**May 2, 2024, Accepted Paper**: Our high-dimensional analysis paper got accepted to ICML. We study the combination of 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with linear regression on data from a spiked covariance model to provide precise
asymptotic guarantees for the risk.\

**April 26, 2024, Accepted Paper**: Our work on integrating Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) into Gaussian Processes 
was accepted at UAI. We show that the resulting GP-RFM is a strong alternative to existing SOTA methods for tabular 
regression problems.\
