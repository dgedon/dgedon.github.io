I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"}, Sweden advised by
[Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/){:target="_blank"} (main),
[Niklas Wahlström](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N16-250){:target="_blank"} 
and [Antônio H. Ribeiro](https://antonior92.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
I am fully supported by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/){:target="_blank"}.

In my research I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations.
I am interested in
- low-dimensional data representation learning,
- neural networks dynamics and implicit biases,
- the role of overparameterization,
- unsupervised representation learning.

On the applied side, my research uses deep models for the evaluation of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings to
(1) support physicians with diagnosis and (2) explore the information within those recordings.

## Latest research results and news

**May 2, 024, Accepted Paper**: Our high-dimensional analysis paper got accepted to ICML. We study the combination of 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with linear regression on data from a spiked covariance model to provide precise
asymptotic guarantees for the risk.

**April 26, 2024, Accepted Paper**: Our work on integrating Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) into Gaussian Processes 
was accepted at UAI. We show that the resulting GP-RFM is a strong alternative to existing SOTA methods for tabular 
regression problems.

**November 6, 2023, Accepted Paper**: The first work from my research visit at Misha Belkins Lab at UCSD was accepted 
at the UniReps workshop at NeurIPS. We studied the emergence of similar representations in Recursive Feature Machines 
and in GPs with Automatic Relevance Determination.\
