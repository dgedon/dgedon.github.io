I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"}, Sweden advised by
[Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/){:target="_blank"} (main),
[Niklas Wahlström](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N16-250){:target="_blank"} 
and [Antônio H. Ribeiro](https://antonior92.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
I am fully supported by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/){:target="_blank"}.

In my research I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations.
I am interested in
- low-dimensional representations of the data and how to explicitly make use of them,
- training of neural networks and its implicit bias,
- transfer learning and unsupervised pre-training,
- the role of overparameterization.

On the applied side, my research uses deep models for the evaluation of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings to
(1) help physicians with diagnosis and (2) explore the information within those recordings.

## Latest research results and news

**July 4, 2023, Accepted Paper**: Another work ours using ECGs + deep learning got accepted at PLOS Neglected Tropical
Diseases. We show that deep learning models can be used to detect Chagas disease from ECGs, aiding in early detection\

**June 28, 2023, Invited Talk**: A talk on our preprint survey paper of deep networks for system identification got 
accepted at the 2023 European Research Network System Identification (ERNSI) workshop in Stockholm. 
We got a special 1h presentation slot.\

**May 11, 2023, Accepted Paper**: Our paper on invertible kernel PCA got accepted at IEEE Signal Processing Letters.
We present a simple but effective method to invert the kernel PCA operations in an invertible subdomain which is 
sufficient for reconstruction in many scenarios.\

**January 03, 2023, Research Visit**: I will visit Misha Belkin's group at UC San Diego from 1st of March to 27th of May.
During that time we will work on generalization of overparameterized models.\
