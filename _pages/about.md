I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Tübingen AI center](https://tuebingen.ai){:target="_blank"} at the University of Tübingen, Germany working with [Jakob Macke](https://www.mackelab.org){:target="_blank"}. 

<!--Mainly, I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations. -->
My research is fairly diverse.
Mainly, I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations to then apply it to solve scientific problems.
Specifically, I am interested in
- modelling of temporal data,
- automated model discovery,
- the role of overparameterization.

On the applied side, I develop deep models for
(1) automated evaluations of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, and
(2) for systems pharmacology models, with focus on chronic kidney disease.

## Latest research results and news

**September 15, 2024, Postdoc**: I started my postdoc at the [Tübingen AI center](https://tuebingen.ai){:target="_blank"} at the University of Tübingen, Germany.

**June 14, 2024, Ph.D.**: I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis "On Deep Learning for Low-Dimensional Representations".\

**May 2, 2024, Accepted Paper**: Our high-dimensional analysis paper got accepted to ICML. We study the combination of 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with linear regression on data from a spiked covariance model to provide precise
asymptotic guarantees for the risk.\

**April 26, 2024, Accepted Paper**: Our work on integrating Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) into Gaussian Processes 
was accepted at UAI. We show that the resulting GP-RFM is a strong alternative to existing SOTA methods for tabular 
regression problems.\
