I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"}, Sweden advised by
[Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/){:target="_blank"} (main),
[Niklas Wahlström](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N16-250){:target="_blank"} 
and [Antônio H. Ribeiro](https://antonior92.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
I am fully supported by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/){:target="_blank"}.

In my research I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations.
I am interested in
- the double-descent phenomenon and the role of overparameterization
- training of neural networks and its implicit bias
- transfer learning and unsupervised pre-training

On the applied side, my research uses deep models for the evaluation of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings to
(1) help physicians with diagnosis and (2) explore the information within those recordings.

## Latest research results and news

**May 11, 2023, Accepted Paper**: Our paper on invertible kernel PCA got accepted at IEEE Signal Processing Letters.
We present a simple but effective method to invert the kernel PCA operations in an invertible subdomain which is 
sufficient for reconstruction in many scenarios.\

**January 03, 2023, Research Visit**: I will visit Misha Belkin's group at UC San Diego from 1st of March to 27th of May.
During that time we will work on generalization of overparameterized models.\

**November 22, 2022, Invited Talk**: The bi-annual joint meeting from the Swedish and Danish societies for
biopharmaceutical/medical statistics (DSBS, FMS), invited me to talk about our latest work in prediction models for 
myocardial infarctions from ECGs.\
