I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Tübingen AI center](https://tuebingen.ai){:target="_blank"} at the University of Tübingen, Germany, working with [Jakob Macke](https://www.mackelab.org){:target="_blank"}.

<!--Mainly, I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations.
My research is fairly diverse.
 -->
Generally, I aim to build machine learning tools for scientific discovery.
I try to understand machine learning algorithms through theory and empirical observations to then build rigorously grounded methods to solve scientific problems.
Specifically, I am interested in
- scientific and mechanistic model discovery,
- simulation-based inference,
- foundation models for scientific data,
- modeling of dynamical systems.

On the applied side, I develop deep models for
(1) systems pharmacology models, with focus on chronic kidney disease,and
(2) for automated evaluation of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings.
