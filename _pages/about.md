I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"}, Sweden advised by
[Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/){:target="_blank"} (main),
[Niklas Wahlström](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N16-250){:target="_blank"} 
and [Antônio H. Ribeiro](https://antonior92.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
I am fully supported by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/){:target="_blank"}.

In my research I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations.
I am interested in
- the double-descent phenomenon and the role of overparameterization
- training of neural networks and its implicit bias
- transfer learning and unsupervised pre-training

On the applied side, my research uses deep models for the evaluation of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings to
(1) help physicians with diagnosis and (2) explore the information within those recordings.
