I am a Ph.D. candidate in deep learning at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"} in Sweden. 
My main supervisor is [Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/){:target="_blank"} and I am
co-supervised by [Niklas Wahlström](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N16-250){:target="_blank"} 
and [Antônio H. Ribeiro](https://antonior92.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
I am fully supported by the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/){:target="_blank"}.
My Ph.D. is planned to be finished in the summer of 2024 which concludes the five year program.

I received my B.Eng. in Aerospace Engineering from the 
[Baden-Württemberg Corporate State University](https://www.ravensburg.dhbw.de/startseite){:target="_blank"}, Germany in 2015 which was in
cooperation with [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/space){:target="_blank"}, Friedrichshafen in Germany.
In 2019 I received my M.Sc. degree in Systems and Control from [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/){:target="_blank"} in the Netherlands.
Between my B.Eng. and M.Sc. degree I have one year of industrial experience in the aerospace industry at Airbus Space.
Since 2019 I am pursing my Ph.D. degree.

My research can be split within the field of deep learning in two areas. 
The applied side revolves around medical problems. In particular, we look at 
[ECG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography){:target="_blank"} recordings and 
try to improve the classification of medical conditions with deep learning based models. 
The theoretical side of my research focuses in general on understanding how specific deep models works.
Specifically, I am interested in unsupervised and self-supervised learning methods and 
what they are learning from the given data. For details about the results, see my [publications](/publications).
