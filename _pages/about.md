I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"}, Sweden advised by
[Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/){:target="_blank"} (main),
[Niklas Wahlström](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N16-250){:target="_blank"} 
and [Antônio H. Ribeiro](https://antonior92.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
I am fully supported by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/){:target="_blank"}.

In my research I try to understand deep learning through theory and empirical observations.
I am interested in
- the double-descent phenomenon and the role of overparameterization
- training of neural networks and its implicit bias
- transfer learning and unsupervised pre-training

On the applied side, my research uses deep models for the evaluation of electrocardiogram recordings to 
a) help physicians with diagnosis and 2) explore the information within those recordings.
